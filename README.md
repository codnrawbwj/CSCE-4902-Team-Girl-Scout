<Example 1>
- Member 1: Badge Page Square & Member Page Square & Group Page Square & search bar (if possible)
- Member 2: Badge Page List & Member Page List & Group Page List & search bar (if possible)
- Member 3: Badge Details + Member Details (In process of designing the details) & Contents for "About", "Privacy Policy", and "Terms of Use"
- Member 4: All Settings (including "Name", "Team", "Theme", "Notification" (if necessary), and creating and deleting account/saving data in *internal* storage) (Reason: External storage costs us $$.) (In process of designing the details)
- **Difficulty (in my opinion): 4 (due to the internal storage part) > 1 = 2 > 3**

<Example 2>
  
- Member 1: half of UI (all badge, member, group pages)
- Member 2: the other half of UI
- Member 3: member 1's functions (all detail pages and setting)
- Member 4: member 2's functions
- **Difficulty (in my opinion): 4 > 2 > 1 > 3**
- **Drawback: 2 & 4 cannot code until 1 & 3 finish.**

## Step 3. Code the App

## Step 4. Publish the App
